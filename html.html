                <P>
                    How does html really work? I can set this up for when i go to css i can change only this specific paragraph?
                    When is it a good idea to use a line break? How long does it take to get job ready and for all this to make sense?
                    How do you use the class tag to section off certain things? I was going to use a nav bar but i do not rememeber how to set it up. 
                </P>

                    My name is john and im 30 years old. I live in indiana in the US. I started to learn coding for a very short time. This is all done by memory. I am a father of 4. Im a construction worker ive been into construction for about 15 years. Im looking to learn a new set of skills to get out of a dead end job. I enjoy coding and finding problems i may get angry at times but its only cause im passionate in my work.
